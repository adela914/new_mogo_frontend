# New Mogo Frontned ðŸ¥˜

Mogo means "Eat!" in Korean. This application is for people who have a craving for good authentic Korean Restaurants in Berlin. In this application people can share their favorite restaurants and their experiences about the restaurants.

This app is the new version of my Mogo side project. (Click [here](https://github.com/adela914/mogo) to see the first version!)
I started from the scratch again and replace it with modern tech stacks in order to widen my knowledge and try new technologies.

Currently only partially done and still in progress.
